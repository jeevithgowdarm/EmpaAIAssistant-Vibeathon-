Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Overview

App/Website Name: EmpaAI



EmpaAI is an innovative AI-powered web application designed to foster inclusion, empathy, and accessibility by bridging communication gaps between disabled and non-disabled users. The platform leverages advanced artificial intelligence to detect sign language, analyze facial expressions, provide real-time speech-to-text conversion, and offer multilingual translation capabilities for users with hearing or speech impairments. Additionally, it provides emotional wellness support and lifestyle analysis for all users through AI-driven mood detection and personalized recommendations.



The target audience includes individuals with hearing or speech disabilities seeking improved communication tools, as well as non-disabled users looking for emotional wellness support and lifestyle improvement guidance. The key problems addressed are real-time communication barriers faced by disabled individuals, lack of accessible communication tools, and unaddressed emotional wellness needs across all user demographics.
